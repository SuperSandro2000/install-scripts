# Sandro's Install Scripts

Just some install scripts for programs I use common and that aren't installable with a package manager or the packaged version is to old for me.

## Requirements

For now this scripts only work on Debian-based systems and you require the following:

* a Internet connection
* `apt`
* `sudo`
